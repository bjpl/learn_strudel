# Learn Strudel

Algorithmic music composition learning project using Strudel live coding with AI-powered agent orchestration.

## Overview

Personal learning project exploring Strudel (JavaScript-based music live coding language) with Claude Flow agent orchestration for automated music composition patterns.

## Tech Stack

- **Core**: Python 3.x
- **AI Orchestration**: Claude Flow + Ruv-Swarm architecture
- **Music Platform**: Strudel (JavaScript live coding)
- **Storage**: SQLite (agent memory persistence)
- **Integration**: Symbiotic multi-MCP stack

## Technical Overview

This project demonstrates integration between AI agent systems and algorithmic music composition. The implementation includes specialized agents for different aspects of Strudel music patterns, coordinated through Claude Flow's distributed architecture.

**Key Components:**
- Strudel agent registry system
- Symbiotic orchestrator for multi-agent coordination
- Performance monitoring dashboard
- Latin melodic composition examples

**Project Structure:**
- `strudel_music_agents.py` - Agent registry and specialized music composition agents
- `symbiotic_orchestrator.py` - Multi-agent coordination system
- `setup_symbiotic_stack.py` - MCP stack configuration
- `latin_melodic_composition/` - Example compositions
- `performance_dashboard.py` - Agent performance monitoring

**For Technical Review:**
Those interested in the implementation can explore the agent orchestration patterns and Strudel integration approach in the Python modules.
